This React Native bug occurs when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, specifically when dealing with complex data structures like objects or arrays. The issue is that AsyncStorage only stores strings, and when you try to retrieve a complex object, you might encounter issues in parsing it back into the correct data type if the string representation is not handled properly.  For example, if you store an object using JSON.stringify, and then parse it with JSON.parse, there's a chance for errors if the stored string is corrupted or if the object has cyclical references.
