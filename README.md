# React Native AsyncStorage Data Parsing Bug
This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using AsyncStorage in React Native to handle complex data structures.  The bug arises from AsyncStorage's limitation to only store strings, leading to potential errors during the parsing of retrieved data.

## Bug Description
The core issue is the loss of data type integrity when storing and retrieving objects or arrays.  Improper handling of JSON.stringify and JSON.parse can result in data corruption, type errors, and unexpected application behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves robust error handling and careful consideration of data serialization and deserialization.  Implementing checks for data validity and using a more structured approach to data management can help prevent these issues.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the behavior and note potential errors in the console.
